1.Explanation for all the files in the alignment page


The tophat alignment with multimappers is in
all.sorted.bam
this file is split into uniq.sorted.bam containing only the unique mappers and the multi.sorted.bam containing only the multi-mappers. Coverage profiles were generated from the uniq.sorted.bam file

the namesorted.bam is the uniq sorted bam file that is sorted by name. This is important for a tool like htseq-count when using paired end reads.
There is already a file containing htseq-counts per gene called "htseq-count". You could use these files to create an expression matrix for DE-tools. But htseq-count has many parameters, and maybe you want different ones. junctions_bed is a file containing the tophat discovered junctions.

matched.sorted.bam contains the sequences that were filtered in the cleaning step against rRNA + ERCC the spike ins.





2. Tool in new state because of missing metadata


tools stay in new state if metadata did not complete.
Users should set metadata manually.
